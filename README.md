And that would everything for this workshop. As the result of this workshop is:
- understanding how Node servers work
- understanding websockets and ability to use them with Node servers
- ability to connect backend and frontend worlds to make complete apps
- taking advantage of npm packages
- basic knowledge of libraries like Socket.IO/Express
- understanding of Javascript events
- meeting esnext syntax (we used ES 2016, 2017 is not a standard yet)

Thanks a lot!
